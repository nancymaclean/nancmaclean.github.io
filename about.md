I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in History at Duke specializing in the fields of Colonial American, Atlantic, and military history. My dissertation, "From Power to Profit: Natives and Non-natives in the Lower Mississippi Valley, 1763-1803," investigates late eighteenth-century interactions between Choctaws, Chickasaws, and non-natives within the lower Mississippi River Valley. The focus of my research is to assess the impacts of native actions on the economies of the lower valley. I do this by examining records, including censuses, travel journals, and financial documents, that trace the movement of people and goods. My dissertation argues that Choctaws and Chickasaws repeatedly confronted potentially devastating processes, including Euro-American intrusion, diplomatic negotiations, and warfare, but used their demographic, military, and diplomatic power to turn these threats into opportunities that benefitted them and shaped the economies of their non-native neighbors.

### More Information

When not combing through the archives or writing, I enjoy spending time on the water (fishing) or under the night sky (stargazing). And of course, getting out to the old pumpkin patch when the time comes.
